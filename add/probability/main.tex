\chapter{Probability Theory}
When talking about quantum mechanics, it is often considered
an applied part of classical probability theory. Such an assumption
is only partly true; the probabilities underlying effects such as
entangled states and nonclassical light have a fundamentally
nonclassical nature, i.e., they are not described by classical
Kolmogorov probability theory. The material in this section is mainly
based on the monographs \cite{bHolevo2003} and \cite{bHolevo2003add}, which provide a 
comparison between classical and quantum probability theory.
