\chapter{Probability Theory}
When talking about quantum mechanics, it is very often considered an applied part of classical probability theory. Such an assumption is only partially correct, as the probabilities underlying effects such as entangled states and non-classical light have a fundamentally non-classical nature, i.e., they are not described by classical Kolmogorov probability theory. The material in this section mainly relies on the monographs \cite{bHolevo2003} and \cite{bHolevo2003add}, which compare classical and quantum probability theory.
