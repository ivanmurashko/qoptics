\caption{Proof that $L_U \notin R$. 
  If $L_U \in R$, then the universal Turing machine $M_U$ can be
  constructed for the Turing machine $M_d$, which accepts all strings
  of the language $L_d$, which is impossible due to the theorem 
  \ref{theoremAddAlgoTuringLdUndecidability}. $T$ is a special
  device that creates a code for the Turing machine
  $M_i$ based on the string $x_i$, which does not accept $x_i$.}
