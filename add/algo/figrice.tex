\caption{Rice's theorem. The Turing machine $M_P$ recognizing a nontrivial property of the language $P$ is used to construct a universal Turing machine $M_U$ which can both accept and reject pairs of strings $\left(x, M\right)$. The adapter $T$ is used to transform the pair of strings $\left(x, M\right)$ into a code for the Turing machine $M'$ which satisfies the property $P$ if and only if $M$ accepts $x$.}
