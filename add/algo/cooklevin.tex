\subsection{Cook-Levin Theorem}

Once we introduced the complexity class $NPC$, the question arises about the problems included in it. Below it will be shown that the SAT problem (on the satisfiability of a boolean formula in conjunctive normal form) is $NP$ complete.

\begin{theorem}[Cook-Levin]
The problem of the satisfiability of a boolean formula in CNF is NP complete, i.e., belongs to the class $NPC$.
\label{theoremAddAlgoCookTheorem}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The proof consists of two parts. First, we must prove that the SAT problem (see example \ref{exAddAlgoSAT}) belongs to the class $NP$. Second, we must show that any problem from the class $NP$ can be reduced to the SAT problem in polynomial time.
  
  Membership in the class $NP$ is proven in an obvious way, - since there is the possibility of verifying the truth of a solution in $O\left(N\right)$ steps, where $N$ is the number of boolean operations used in the given boolean formula.

 
  TBD
