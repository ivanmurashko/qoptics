\caption{Turing machine $M$ as a function $m(x)$. The input consists of a certain sequence of initial data $x$ (initial symbols on the tape). On output, $M$ can be in some final state (1 - accept $x$), halt (0 - reject $x$) - i.e., be in a state with no further transitions. The machine can also enter an infinite loop and never complete its work.}
