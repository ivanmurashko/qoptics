\caption{Results of the numerical calculation of the photon distribution. Curve
  1, which describes the photon distribution below the generation threshold,
  was obtained with the following parameters: $A = 10$, $\frac{\omega}{Q} = 12$,
  $B = 1$. Curve 2, corresponding to the generation threshold, was obtained at $A = 10$, $\frac{\omega}{Q} = 8$,
  $B = 1$. For curve 3, the parameters were $A = 10$, $\frac{\omega}{Q} = 3$,
  $B = 1$, which corresponds to exceeding the threshold.}
