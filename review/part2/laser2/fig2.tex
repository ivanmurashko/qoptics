\caption{Laser model. The resonator in which the generated mode is excited, interacting with the active atoms of the working medium $A$, is denoted by $F$. Additionally, there are two reservoirs at temperature $T$: $R_{a}$, which is connected to the active atoms, and $R_{F}$, connected to the mode.}
