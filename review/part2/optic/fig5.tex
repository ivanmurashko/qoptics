\caption{To the derivation of $P_m\left(t, t' + dt'\right)$. There are two possibilities of obtaining $m$ counts in the time interval $t, t' + dt'$: $m$ counts are made in the interval $t$, $t'$, and none in the interval $dt$; $m - 1$ counts are made in the interval $t$, $t'$, and one in the interval $dt'$.}
