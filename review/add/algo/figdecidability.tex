\caption{Turing machine $M$ as a function $m(x)$. The input consists of some sequence of initial data $x$ (initial symbols on the tape).
At the output, $M$ may be in some final state
(1 - accept $x$), hang (0 - reject $x$) â€“ i.e., be in
a state from which there are no further transitions. The machine may also
enter an infinite loop and never finish its work}
