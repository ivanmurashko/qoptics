\caption{Uncertainty region and the corresponding dependence
  of the electric field on time for a coherent
  state.
  The complex number $\alpha$,
  corresponding to the considered state $\left|\alpha\right>$ on the
  complex plane defined by $X_1$ and $X_2$, lies along the
  $X_1$ axis.
  In this case, the number $\alpha$ is real, the average value
  $\left<\alpha\right|\hat{X_1}\left|\alpha\right> =
  \frac{\alpha + \alpha^\ast}{2} = 
  Re \alpha = \alpha$.
  Thus, the uncertainty $\Delta X_1$ can
  be interpreted as the amplitude uncertainty, and $\Delta X_2$ as
  the phase uncertainty. In the case of a coherent
  (unsqueezed) state shown in the figure, the uncertainty in phase and amplitude is the same.}
