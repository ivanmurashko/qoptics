\caption{Balanced scheme of a homodyne detector. The tested signal
  ($\hat{a}_0$) and the homodyne mode signal ($\hat{a}_1$) are fed into
  the mirror $M$ with reflection coefficient $r=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and
  transmission coefficient $t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. The signals after passing
  through the mirror are registered by two photodetectors $D^{(2)}$ and $D^{(3)}$,
  the outputs of which are fed into a subtractor $E$.}
