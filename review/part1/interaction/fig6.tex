\caption{Coordinate system in which it is convenient to average
  a multimode field over all directions and polarizations. The wave
  vector of the electromagnetic wave $\vec{k}$ is directed along the $z$ axis, while
  the position of the matrix element of the dipole moment $\vec{p}$
  is determined by the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$. The polarization vectors $\vec{e}_1$ and $\vec{e}_2$
are directed along the $x$ and $y$ axes. The angle $\phi'$ defines the direction
of polarization of the electromagnetic wave.}
