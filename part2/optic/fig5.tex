\caption{To the conclusion $P_m\left(t, t' + dt'\right)$. There are two possibilities for obtaining $m$ counts in the time interval $t, t' + dt'$: in the interval $t, t'$, $m$ counts are made, and in the interval $dt$, none; in the interval $t, t'$, $m - 1$ counts are made, and in the interval $dt'$ - one.}
