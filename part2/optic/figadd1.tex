\caption{Scheme for measuring second-order coherence. Two
  photodetectors $D^{(1)}$ and $D^{(2)}$ are located at points in space,
  defined by vectors $\vec{r}_1$ and $\vec{r}_2$. The signal from $D^{(2)}$
passes through a delay $\tau$, so the coincidence circuit $E$
registers the simultaneous absorption of two photons, one at point
$\vec{r}_1$ at time $t_1 = t$, and the second at point
$\vec{r}_2$ at time $t_2 = t - \tau$.}
