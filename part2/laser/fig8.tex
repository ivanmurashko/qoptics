\caption{To the calculation of the generation line width of the laser. Dependence of the spectral power density $S\left(\omega\right)$ on the frequency $\omega$. The line width is determined by half the power, i.e., those values of $\omega$ are considered for which $\frac{S(\omega)}{S(\omega_0)} \ge \frac{1}{2}$. From \eqref{eqCh3_22}, it follows that the interval boundaries correspond to frequencies $\omega = \omega_0 \pm \frac{D}{2}$. Thus, the line width is $D$.}
