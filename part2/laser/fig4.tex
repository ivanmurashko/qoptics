\caption{Results of the numerical calculation of the photon distribution. Graph
  1, which describes the photon distribution before the generation threshold,
  was obtained with the following parameters: $A = 10$, $\frac{\omega}{Q} = 12$,
  $B = 1$. Graph 2, corresponding to the generation threshold, was obtained with $A = 10$, $\frac{\omega}{Q} = 8$,
  $B = 1$. For graph 3, $A = 10$, $\frac{\omega}{Q} = 3$,
  $B = 1$ was accepted, which corresponds to exceeding the threshold.}
