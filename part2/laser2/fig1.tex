\caption{Diagram of laser levels. Level $c$ is the ground level, level $b$ is the lower working level, and $a$ is the upper working level. $\gamma_a$ and $\gamma_b$ characterize the relaxation of populations from levels $a$ and $b$ due to coupling with the dissipative system. $r_a$ is the pumping rate of the upper working level $a$ due to incoherent optical pumping.}
