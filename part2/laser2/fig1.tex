\caption{Diagram of laser levels. Level $c$ - ground level, level $b$ - lower working level, $a$ - upper working level. $\gamma_a$ and $\gamma_b$ characterize relaxation of populations from levels $a$ and $b$ due to the connection with the dissipative system. $r_a$ - pumping rate of the upper working level $a$ due to incoherent optical pumping.}
