\section{General Theory of Interaction of a Dynamic System with a Thermostat}

So far, we have dealt with a specific model of the interaction of a resonator mode (dynamic system) with an atomic beam in equilibrium at temperature $T$ (with a reservoir). Here we consider a more general approach to the problem of interaction between a dynamic system and a reservoir \cite{bLaks1974}. We are dealing with two interacting systems: $A$ - the dynamic system and $B$ - the reservoir (dissipative system). The systems $A$ and $B$ are weakly connected, meaning the binding energy is small compared to the energy of the dynamic system. We denote the interaction Hamiltonian as $\hat{V}$. The dissipative system $B$ is a vast system in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature $T$. We will initially consider systems $A$ and $B$ as equal. Let the statistical operator of the full system be $\hat{\rho}_{AB}$. We introduce statistical operators $\hat{\rho}_{A}$ and $\hat{\rho}_{B}$ related respectively to systems $A$ and $B$. These are related to the operator $\hat{\rho}_{AB}$ by the relations 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_{A} = Sp_B\left\{\hat{\rho}_{AB}\right\}, \quad
\hat{\rho}_{B} = Sp_A\left\{\hat{\rho}_{AB}\right\}, \quad
\label{eqCh2_78}
\end{equation}
The equation of motion of the statistical operator of the entire combined system in the interaction representation has the form 
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\dot{\hat{\rho}}_{AB}
 = \left[
\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{AB}
\right].
\label{eqCh2_79}
\end{equation}
The equations of motion for reduced operators are evidently equal to
\begin{eqnarray}
i\hbar\dot{\hat{\rho}}_{A} = Sp_B
\left[
\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{AB}
\right],
\nonumber \\
i\hbar\dot{\hat{\rho}}_{B} = Sp_A
\left[
\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{AB}
\right].
\label{eqCh2_80}
\end{eqnarray}
We represent the statistical operator $\hat{\rho}_{AB}$ in the following form
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_{AB} = \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} + \hat{\rho}_{C},
\label{eqCh2_81}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\rho}_{C}$ is a consequence of the interaction between systems, $\otimes$ denotes the outer (tensor) product.
\rindex{Tensor Product}
At the initial moment $t_0$, the systems are assumed to be non-interacting, then the full statistical operator equals the outer product
\[
\left.\hat{\rho}_{AB}\right|_{t = t_0} = \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B},
\] 
and 
\[
\left.\hat{\rho}_{C}\right|_{t = t_0} = 0.
\] 
Let us now transform the term 
$\left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B}\right]$,
included in equation \eqref{eqCh2_80}, and we obtain  
\begin{eqnarray}
\left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B}\right] = 
\hat{V}  \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} - 
\hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} \hat{V} = 
\nonumber \\
= \hat{V}  \hat{\rho}_{B} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{A} - 
\hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} \hat{V}.
\label{eqCh2_82}
\end{eqnarray}
since 
\(
\hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} = 
\hat{\rho}_{B} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{A}
\)   because $\hat{\rho}_{A}$ and $\hat{\rho}_{B}$ act on
different variables. From here, performing the operation $Sp_B$, we have 
\begin{eqnarray}
Sp_B \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B}\right] = 
Sp_B\left(\hat{V} \hat{\rho}_{B}\right) \hat{\rho}_{A} - 
\nonumber \\
-
\hat{\rho}_{A} Sp_B \left(\hat{\rho}_{B} \hat{V}\right) = 
\left[\hat{V}_A, \hat{\rho}_A\right],
\label{eqCh2_83}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\hat{V}_A = Sp_B\left(\hat{V}\hat{\rho}_B\right)$. Similarly, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
Sp_A \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B}\right] =
\left[\hat{V}_B, \hat{\rho}_B\right],
\label{eqCh2_84}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{V}_B= Sp_A\left(\hat{V}\hat{\rho}_A\right)$.  
Considering the equalities \eqref{eqCh2_81}, \eqref{eqCh2_82},
\eqref{eqCh2_83}, \eqref{eqCh2_84}, the equations of motion 
for $\hat{\rho}_{A}$ and $\hat{\rho}_{B}$ can be represented as  
\begin{eqnarray}
i\hbar\frac{d}{d t} \hat{\rho}_A\left(t\right) = 
\left[\hat{V}_A\left(t\right), \hat{\rho}_A\right] +
Sp_B \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right],
\nonumber \\
i\hbar\frac{d}{d t} \hat{\rho}_B\left(t\right) = 
\left[\hat{V}_B\left(t\right), \hat{\rho}_B\right] +
Sp_A \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right].
\label{eqCh2_85}
\end{eqnarray}
From the form of \eqref{eqCh2_85} it is clear that $\hat{V}_A$ and $\hat{V}_B$ have
the meaning of the energy change of one system connected with its interaction with
another, such as the interaction of a dynamic system with
a thermostat. These changes are small and in our case can be neglected. Thus \eqref{eqCh2_85} transforms into 
\begin{eqnarray}
i\hbar\frac{d}{d t} \hat{\rho}_A\left(t\right) = 
Sp_B \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right],
\nonumber \\
i\hbar\frac{d}{d t} \hat{\rho}_B\left(t\right) = 
Sp_A \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right].
\label{eqCh2_85a}
\end{eqnarray}

For the operator $\hat{\rho}_C$, using the fact that  
\[
\hat{\rho}_C = \hat{\rho}_{AB} - \hat{\rho}_A \otimes \hat{\rho}_B
\]
we can write the equation of motion as follows
\begin{eqnarray}
i \hbar \frac{d \hat{\rho}_C}{d t} = i \hbar \frac{d
  \hat{\rho}_{AB}}{d t} - i \hbar 
\frac{d}{d t} \left(\hat{\rho}_A \otimes \hat{\rho}_B\right) = 
\nonumber \\
= i \hbar
\left(
\frac{d \hat{\rho}_{AB}}{d t} -
\frac{d \hat{\rho}_{A}}{d t} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} - 
\hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \frac{d \hat{\rho}_{B}}{d t}
\right).
\label{eqCh2_86}
\end{eqnarray}
Using the equations of motion for $\hat{\rho}_{AB}$, $\hat{\rho}_{A}$,
$\hat{\rho}_{B}$  \eqref{eqCh2_85a},  for \eqref{eqCh2_86} we obtain 
\begin{eqnarray}
i \hbar \frac{d \hat{\rho}_C}{d t} = 
\left[\hat{V}, \left(\hat{\rho}_A \otimes \hat{\rho}_B +
  \hat{\rho}_{C}\right)\right] - 
\nonumber \\
- 
\left(Sp_B\left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right]\right)\hat{\rho}_B -
\hat{\rho}_A \left(Sp_A\left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right]\right)
\label{eqCh2_89}
\end{eqnarray}
Neglecting second-order small terms, we obtain a simple equation:
\begin{equation}
i \hbar \frac{d \hat{\rho}_C}{d t} = 
\left[\hat{V}, \left(\hat{\rho}_A \otimes \hat{\rho}_B\right)\right]. 
\label{eqCh2_90}
\end{equation}
First-order small terms are $\hat{V}$, $\hat{\rho}_C$.
This follows from the assumption that interaction between the dynamic
system and the thermostat is small. Terms involving products like $\hat{V}\hat{\rho}_C$ are considered small of the second order. A formal solution to equation \eqref{eqCh2_90} is 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_C\left(t\right) = - \frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_0}^t
\left[\hat{V}\left(t'\right), \left(\hat{\rho}_A \otimes
  \hat{\rho}_B\right)\right] dt' 
\label{eqCh2_91}
\end{equation}
with initial conditions $\hat{\rho}_C\left(t_0\right) = 0$. 

So far, we have considered systems $A$ and $B$ as equal. Now we take into account that the dynamic system $A$ is small, and the dissipative system $B$ is so large that interaction with the dynamic system cannot significantly disrupt its equilibrium. We account for this by setting $\frac{d \hat{\rho}_B}{d t} = 0$: 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t'\right) =
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right).
\label{eqCh2_92}
\end{equation}
Substituting in the equation for $\hat{\rho}_A$ \eqref{eqCh2_85} the equalities \eqref{eqCh2_89} and \eqref{eqCh2_91}, we obtain 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d \hat{\rho}_A}{d t} = - \frac{1}{\hbar^2}
\int_{t_0}^t Sp_B\left[
\hat{V}\left(t\right),
\left[
\hat{V}\left(t'\right),
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right)
\right]
\right]dt' = 
\nonumber \\ 
=
- \frac{1}{\hbar^2}
\int_{t_0}^t d t' Sp_B\left\{
\left[
\hat{V}\left(t\right)
\hat{V}\left(t'\right)
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right) -
\right.
\right.
\nonumber \\
-
\left.
\left.
\hat{V}\left(t\right)
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right)
\hat{V}\left(t'\right)
\right] - 
\right.
\nonumber \\
-
\left.
\left[
\hat{V}\left(t'\right)
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right)
\hat{V}\left(t\right)
-
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right)
\hat{V}\left(t'\right)\hat{V}\left(t\right) 
\right]
\right\}.
\label{eqCh2_93}
\end{eqnarray}

This is the equation for the density operator of the dynamic system $A$ interacting with the dissipative system $B$. For the vast system $B$, the correlation time of $\hat{V}\left(t\right)$ and $\hat{V}\left(t'\right)$ is very small, significantly less than the characteristic time change of $\hat{\rho}_A$. Thus, the significant integration region is in the vicinity of $t' = t$. Then, in many cases during integration, we can set
\[
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) =
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t\right).
\]
