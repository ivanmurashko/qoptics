\section{General Theory of Interaction of a Dynamic System with a Thermostat}

So far, we have dealt with a particular model of the interaction of a resonator mode (dynamic system) with an atomic beam in equilibrium at temperature $T$ (with a reservoir). Here we will consider a more general approach to the problem of interaction of a dynamic system with a reservoir \cite{bLaks1974}. We are dealing with two interacting systems: $A$ - a dynamic system, and $B$ - a reservoir (dissipative system). Systems $A$ and $B$ are weakly coupled, meaning the coupling energy is small compared to the energy of the dynamic system. The interaction Hamiltonian is denoted by $\hat{V}$. The dissipative system $B$ is an extensive system in thermodynamic equilibrium at temperature $T$. Initially, the systems $A$ and $B$ will be considered on equal footing. Denote the statistical operator of the whole system by $\hat{\rho}_{AB}$. 

Introduce statistical operators $\hat{\rho}_{A}$ and $\hat{\rho}_{B}$ referring respectively only to systems $A$ and $B$. These operators are related to operator $\hat{\rho}_{AB}$ by the relations 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_{A} = Sp_B\left\{\hat{\rho}_{AB}\right\}, \quad
\hat{\rho}_{B} = Sp_A\left\{\hat{\rho}_{AB}\right\}, \quad
\label{eqCh2_78}
\end{equation}
The equation of motion for the statistical operator of the whole combined system in the interaction representation is 
\begin{equation}
i\hbar\dot{\hat{\rho}}_{AB}
 = \left[
\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{AB}
\right].
\label{eqCh2_79}
\end{equation}
The equations of motion for the reduced operators are clearly 
\begin{eqnarray}
i\hbar\dot{\hat{\rho}}_{A} = Sp_B
\left[
\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{AB}
\right],
\nonumber \\
i\hbar\dot{\hat{\rho}}_{B} = Sp_A
\left[
\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{AB}
\right].
\label{eqCh2_80}
\end{eqnarray}
The statistical operator $\hat{\rho}_{AB}$ can be represented in the form
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_{AB} = \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} + \hat{\rho}_{C},
\label{eqCh2_81}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{\rho}_{C}$ arises from the interaction between the systems, $\otimes$ denotes the external (tensor) product. 
\rindex{Tensor product}
At the initial time $t_0$ the systems are assumed to be non-interacting, so the total statistical operator equals the tensor product 
\[
\left.\hat{\rho}_{AB}\right|_{t = t_0} = \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B},
\] 
and 
\[
\left.\hat{\rho}_{C}\right|_{t = t_0} = 0.
\] 
Now transform the term 
$\left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B}\right]$
appearing in equation \eqref{eqCh2_80}, and obtain  
\begin{eqnarray}
\left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B}\right] = 
\hat{V}  \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} - 
\hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} \hat{V} = 
\nonumber \\
= \hat{V}  \hat{\rho}_{B} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{A} - 
\hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} \hat{V}.
\label{eqCh2_82}
\end{eqnarray}
because 
\(
\hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} = 
\hat{\rho}_{B} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{A}
\)   due to the fact that $\hat{\rho}_{A}$ and $\hat{\rho}_{B}$ act on different variables. From here, applying the partial trace $Sp_B$, we get 
\begin{eqnarray}
Sp_B \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B}\right] = 
Sp_B\left(\hat{V} \hat{\rho}_{B}\right) \hat{\rho}_{A} - 
\nonumber \\
-
\hat{\rho}_{A} Sp_B \left(\hat{\rho}_{B} \hat{V}\right) = 
\left[\hat{V}_A, \hat{\rho}_A\right],
\label{eqCh2_83}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\hat{V}_A = Sp_B\left(\hat{V}\hat{\rho}_B\right)$. Similarly, we obtain 
\begin{equation}
Sp_A \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B}\right] =
\left[\hat{V}_B, \hat{\rho}_B\right],
\label{eqCh2_84}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{V}_B= Sp_A\left(\hat{V}\hat{\rho}_A\right)$.  
Taking into account the equalities \eqref{eqCh2_81}, \eqref{eqCh2_82},
\eqref{eqCh2_83}, \eqref{eqCh2_84}, the equations of motion 
for $\hat{\rho}_{A}$ and $\hat{\rho}_{B}$ can be written as  
\begin{eqnarray}
i\hbar\frac{d}{d t} \hat{\rho}_A\left(t\right) = 
\left[\hat{V}_A\left(t\right), \hat{\rho}_A\right] +
Sp_B \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right],
\nonumber \\
i\hbar\frac{d}{d t} \hat{\rho}_B\left(t\right) = 
\left[\hat{V}_B\left(t\right), \hat{\rho}_B\right] +
Sp_A \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right].
\label{eqCh2_85}
\end{eqnarray}
From the form of \eqref{eqCh2_85} it is clear that $\hat{V}_A$ and $\hat{V}_B$ represent the energy shifts of one system associated with its interaction with the other, for example, with the interaction of the dynamic system with the thermostat. These changes are small and in our case may be neglected. Thus \eqref{eqCh2_85} reduces to 
\begin{eqnarray}
i\hbar\frac{d}{d t} \hat{\rho}_A\left(t\right) = 
Sp_B \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right],
\nonumber \\
i\hbar\frac{d}{d t} \hat{\rho}_B\left(t\right) = 
Sp_A \left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right].
\label{eqCh2_85a}
\end{eqnarray}

For the operator $\hat{\rho}_C$, using that
\[
\hat{\rho}_C = \hat{\rho}_{AB} - \hat{\rho}_A \otimes \hat{\rho}_B
\]
we can write the equation of motion as
\begin{eqnarray}
i \hbar \frac{d \hat{\rho}_C}{d t} = i \hbar \frac{d
  \hat{\rho}_{AB}}{d t} - i \hbar 
\frac{d}{d t} \left(\hat{\rho}_A \otimes \hat{\rho}_B\right) = 
\nonumber \\
= i \hbar
\left(
\frac{d \hat{\rho}_{AB}}{d t} -
\frac{d \hat{\rho}_{A}}{d t} \otimes \hat{\rho}_{B} - 
\hat{\rho}_{A} \otimes \frac{d \hat{\rho}_{B}}{d t}
\right).
\label{eqCh2_86}
\end{eqnarray}
Using the equations of motion for $\hat{\rho}_{AB}$, $\hat{\rho}_{A}$,
and $\hat{\rho}_{B}$ \eqref{eqCh2_85a}, for \eqref{eqCh2_86} we get 
\begin{eqnarray}
i \hbar \frac{d \hat{\rho}_C}{d t} = 
\left[\hat{V}, \left(\hat{\rho}_A \otimes \hat{\rho}_B +
  \hat{\rho}_{C}\right)\right] - 
\nonumber \\
- 
\left(Sp_B\left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right]\right)\hat{\rho}_B -
\hat{\rho}_A \left(Sp_A\left[\hat{V}, \hat{\rho}_C\right]\right)
\label{eqCh2_89}
\end{eqnarray}
Neglecting terms of second order smallness, we obtain a simple equation:
\begin{equation}
i \hbar \frac{d \hat{\rho}_C}{d t} = 
\left[\hat{V}, \left(\hat{\rho}_A \otimes \hat{\rho}_B\right)\right]. 
\label{eqCh2_90}
\end{equation}
First order small terms are $\hat{V}$ and $\hat{\rho}_C$.
This follows from the assumption that interaction between the dynamic system and the thermostat is small. Terms containing products like $\hat{V}\hat{\rho}_C$ are considered second order small. The formal solution of equation \eqref{eqCh2_90} is  
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_C\left(t\right) = - \frac{i}{\hbar}\int_{t_0}^t
\left[\hat{V}\left(t'\right), \left(\hat{\rho}_A \otimes
  \hat{\rho}_B\right)\right] dt' 
\label{eqCh2_91}
\end{equation}
with initial condition $\hat{\rho}_C\left(t_0\right) = 0$. 

So far, we have considered systems $A$ and $B$ as equal. Now take into account that the dynamic system $A$ is small, while the dissipative system $B$ is so large that its interaction with the dynamic system cannot significantly disturb its equilibrium. Incorporate this by setting $\frac{d \hat{\rho}_B}{d t} = 0$: 
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t'\right) =
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right).
\label{eqCh2_92}
\end{equation}
Substituting into the equation for $\hat{\rho}_A$ \eqref{eqCh2_85} the expressions \eqref{eqCh2_89} and \eqref{eqCh2_91}, we get 
\begin{eqnarray}
\frac{d \hat{\rho}_A}{d t} = - \frac{1}{\hbar^2}
\int_{t_0}^t Sp_B\left[
\hat{V}\left(t\right),
\left[
\hat{V}\left(t'\right),
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right)
\right]
\right]dt' = 
\nonumber \\ 
=
- \frac{1}{\hbar^2}
\int_{t_0}^t d t' Sp_B\left\{
\left[
\hat{V}\left(t\right)
\hat{V}\left(t'\right)
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right) -
\right.
\right.
\nonumber \\
-
\left.
\left.
\hat{V}\left(t\right)
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right)
\hat{V}\left(t'\right)
\right] - 
\right.
\nonumber \\
-
\left.
\left[
\hat{V}\left(t'\right)
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right)
\hat{V}\left(t\right)
-
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) \otimes
\hat{\rho}_B\left(t_0\right)
\hat{V}\left(t'\right)\hat{V}\left(t\right) 
\right]
\right\}.
\label{eqCh2_93}
\end{eqnarray}

This equation is for the density operator of the dynamic system $A$ interacting with the dissipative system $B$. For the extensive system $B$, the correlation time of $\hat{V}\left(t\right)$ and $\hat{V}\left(t'\right)$ is very short, much less than the characteristic time of change of $\hat{\rho}_A$. Therefore, the significant integration region is near $t' = t$. Then in many cases during integration we can put
\[
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t'\right) =
\hat{\rho}_A\left(t\right).
\]
A more detailed exposition of the general theory of interaction of a dynamic system with a thermostat can be found in \cite{bLaks1974}. Let us apply the general theory to specific cases.
