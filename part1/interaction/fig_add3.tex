\caption{Interaction of the electromagnetic field mode of the resonator $F$ with
  the reservoir of atoms $R$ at temperature $T$. $\hat{a}^{\dag}$ and
$\hat{a}$ are the creation and annihilation operators of the studied mode
of the electromagnetic field. $\hat{b}_k^{\dag}$ and
$\hat{b}_k$ are the creation and annihilation operators of the $k$-th mode of the reservoir (phonons).}
