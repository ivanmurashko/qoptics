\caption{Coordinate system in which it is convenient to average
  the multimode field over all directions and polarizations. The wave
  vector of the electromagnetic wave $\vec{k}$ is directed along the $z$-axis, while
  the position of the dipole moment matrix element $\vec{p}$
  is defined by the angles $\theta$ and $\phi$. Polarization vectors $\vec{e}_1$ and $\vec{e}_2$
are directed along the $x$ and $y$ axes. The angle $\phi'$ determines the direction
of polarization of the electromagnetic wave.}
