\chapter{Interaction of Light with an Atom}
\label{chInteraction}

This chapter addresses issues related to the interaction of the quantized electromagnetic field with an atom. A simplified atomic model is used — a two-level atom. Such a simplification is justified under resonant interaction and is widely used in problems of quantum electronics and quantum optics. Special attention is given to the consideration of the interaction between the atom, the resonator mode (dynamic system), and the thermostat (dissipative system), which is responsible for the relaxation of the dynamic system.
