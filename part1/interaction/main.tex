\chapter{Interaction of Light with an Atom}
\label{chInteraction}

Questions related to the interaction of quantized electromagnetic fields with an atom are considered. A simplified model of an atom is used - a two-level atom. Such simplification is justified in resonant interaction and is widely used in problems of quantum electronics and quantum optics. Great attention is paid to the consideration of the interaction of an atom, a mode of a resonator (a dynamic system) with a thermostat (a dissipative system), which is responsible for the relaxation of the dynamic system.
