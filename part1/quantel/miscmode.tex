\section{Mixed States of the Electromagnetic Field}
So far, we have only considered pure states of the electromagnetic field, described by state vectors. One of the most distinctive properties of pure states is the principle of superposition.

Only isolated systems can be pure systems, whereas mixed systems are not isolated from their environment. The density matrix formalism is used to describe mixed states. The density operator can be introduced as follows.

Consider a mixed state, for which the probabilities $P_M$ of the field being in each of the states $\ket{M}$ are known. We calculate the expectation value of the operator $\hat{O}$, corresponding to the observable $O$ in this statistically mixed state. The expectation for the statistical mixture of states  
\begin{equation}
\left<\hat{O}\right> = \sum_{(M)} P_M\bra{M}\hat{O}\ket{M},
\end{equation}
where, obviously, 
\[
\sum_{(M)} P_M = 1.
\]

This expression can be written in another form. Using some complete set of states $\ket{S}$ and its completeness condition 
\[
\sum_{(S)}\ket{S}\bra{S} = \hat{I},
\]
we obtain
\begin{equation}
\left<\hat{O}\right> = \sum_{(M)}
P_M\sum_{(S)}\bra{M}\hat{O}\ket{S}\bra{S}\ket{M}
= \sum_{(M)}\sum_{(S)}P_M\bra{S}\ket{M}\bra{M}\hat{O}\ket{S}.
\label{eqCh1_middle}
\end{equation}

From \eqref{eqCh1_middle}, a statistical operator $\hat{\rho}$ can be introduced using the expression
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho} = \sum_{(M)}
P_M\ket{M}\bra{M}.
\end{equation}

Then the equality \eqref{eqCh1_middle} can be presented as
\begin{equation}
\left<\hat{O}\right> = \sum_{(S)}
\bra{S}\hat{\rho}\hat{O}\ket{S} = Sp \left(\hat{\rho}\hat{O}\right),
\end{equation}
This relation does not depend on the choice of $\ket{S}$, as the trace of an operator is representation-independent. Note that 
\begin{equation}
Sp \left(\hat{\rho}\right) = \sum_{(M)}
\bra{M}\hat{\rho}\ket{M} = \sum_{(M)} P_M = 1.
\label{eqCh1_spequal1}
\end{equation}

As an example, consider thermal photon excitation in one mode:
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho} = \sum_{(n)}
P_n\ket{n}\bra{n},
\label{eqCh1_teplovvozb}
\end{equation}
where $P_n$ is determined by the Boltzmann distribution
\[
P_n = e^{-\beta n \hbar \omega}\left(1  -  e^{-\beta \hbar \omega}\right),
\]
here $\beta = \frac{1}{k_b T}$, and $\left(1  -  e^{-\beta \hbar
  \omega}\right)$ is a normalization factor. 

The average number of photons in the mode under thermal excitation:
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar{n} = \left<\hat{n}\right> =  Sp \left(\hat{\rho}\hat{n}\right) = 
Sp \left(\hat{\rho}\hat{a}^{\dag}\hat{a}\right) = 
\nonumber \\
=\sum_{(m)}\sum_{(n)}
P_n\bra{m}\ket{n}\bra{n}\hat{a}^{\dag}\hat{a}\ket{m}
= 
\nonumber \\
= \sum_{(n)}
P_n\bra{n}\hat{n}\ket{n} = \sum_{(n)} n
e^{-\beta n \hbar \omega}\left(1  -  e^{-\beta \hbar \omega}\right) = 
\frac{1}{e^{\beta \hbar \omega} - 1}
\label{eqCh1_plank}
\end{eqnarray}
This is the well-known expression derived by Planck. We used the following expression
\[
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} n r^{n -1} = \frac{d}{d r} \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}
r^{n} = \frac{1}{\left(1 - r\right)^2},
\]
valid for $\left|r\right| < 1$.

Equations \eqref{eqCh1_teplovvozb}, \eqref{eqCh1_plank} can be rewritten differently. From \eqref{eqCh1_plank} we get 
\[
e^{-\beta \hbar \omega} = \frac{\bar{n}}{1 + \bar{n}},
\]
hence, 
\begin{equation}
P_n = e^{-\beta \hbar \omega n} \left(1  -  e^{-\beta \hbar
  \omega}\right) = \frac{\bar{n}^n}{\left(1 + \bar{n}\right)^{n+1}}.
\label{eqCh1_plank2}
\end{equation}
Thus, the density matrix takes the form:
\[
\hat{\rho} = \sum_{(n)}\frac{\bar{n}^n}{\left(1 + \bar{n}\right)^{n+1}}\ket{n}\bra{n}.
\]
This formula describes the density matrix of chaotic light via $\bar{n}$, the mean number of photons in the mode. Here, $\bar{n}$ does not necessarily depend on frequency according to Planck's formula \eqref{eqCh1_plank2}. The dependence of $\bar{n}$ on frequency determines the line shape of chaotic light (different frequencies correspond to different modes). Generalizing the result, we can write the expression for the statistical operator of chaotic light:  
\begin{equation}
\hat{\rho} = \sum_{\left\{n_k\right\}} P_{\left\{n_k\right\}} \left|\left\{n_k\right\}\right>\left<\left\{n_k\right\}\right| = 
\sum_{\left\{n_k\right\}} 
 \left|\left\{n_k\right\}\right>\left<\left\{n_k\right\}\right|
\prod_{\left\{k\right\}} 
\frac{\bar{n}_k^{n_k}}{\left(1 + \bar{n}_k\right)^{n_k+1}},
\label{eqCh1_102}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{n}_k$ depends on frequency. For example, for chaotic light with a Lorentzian line, 
\[
\bar{n}_k = \frac{I S}{\hbar \omega_{k_0}}
\frac{\gamma}{\left(\omega_{k_0} - \omega_{k}\right)^2 + \gamma^2},
\]
where $\frac{I S}{\hbar \omega_{k_0}}$ is the average number of photons in the beam; $I$ is the beam intensity (energy flux); $S$ is the beam cross-section.
