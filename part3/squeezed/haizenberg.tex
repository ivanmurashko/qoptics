\section{Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle}
In quantum mechanics, two conjugate observables $A$ and $B$
correspond to non-commuting operators $\hat{A}$ and $\hat{B}$,
satisfying the commutation relation
\begin{equation}
\left[
\hat{A}, \hat{B}
\right] = 
\hat{A}\hat{B} - \hat{B}\hat{A} = i \hat{C},
\nonumber
\end{equation}
where $\hat{C}$ is some Hermitian operator. In this case, observables
$A$ and $B$ can only be measured with a certain uncertainty,
expressed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation
(for more details, see \autoref{AddHeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple})
\begin{equation}
\left(
\Delta A \Delta B
\right) \ge \frac{1}{2} \left|\left<\hat{C}\right>\right|,
\label{eqPart3Squeezed2}
\end{equation}
where
\[
\left(\Delta A\right)^2 = \left<\hat{A}^2\right> - \left<\hat{A}\right>^2
\]
and
\[
\left(\Delta B\right)^2 = \left<\hat{B}^2\right> - \left<\hat{B}\right>^2
\]
are the mean square deviations from the average value.
The average $\left<\dots\right>$ corresponds to the quantum state in
which the quantum object is found.

The relation \eqref{eqPart3Squeezed2} only restricts the product
of uncertainties, allowing for states where the uncertainty
of one of the observables is significantly less than that of the other.
If 
\begin{equation}
\left(\Delta A\right)^2 < \frac{1}{2} \left|\left<\hat{C}\right>\right|,
\nonumber
\end{equation}
such a state is called a squeezed state for the observable
$A$. If at the same time the condition of minimal uncertainty is observed
\begin{equation}
\left(
\Delta A \Delta B
\right) = \frac{1}{2} \left|\left<\hat{C}\right>\right|,
\nonumber
\end{equation}
such a state is called perfectly squeezed.
