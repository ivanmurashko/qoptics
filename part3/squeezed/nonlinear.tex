\section{Squeezed Light in Nonlinear Phenomena}
The efficiency of generating higher harmonics can be increased if squeezed light is used as the EMF instead of a coherent state. In particular, the $2N$ harmonic is generated $(2N-1)!!$ times more effectively \cite[pp. 72-76]{bBykov}, where
\[
n!! = \prod_{k=1}^{\frac{n}{2}}(2k)
\]
denotes the double factorial.
