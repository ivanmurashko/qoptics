\section{Squeezed light in nonlinear phenomena}
The efficiency of higher harmonic generation can be increased if squeezed light is used instead of a coherent state as the electromagnetic field. In particular, the $2N$th harmonic is generated $(2N-1)!!$ times more efficiently \cite[pp. 72-76]{bBykov}, where
\[
n!! = \prod_{k=1}^{\frac{n}{2}}(2k)
\]
denotes the double factorial.
