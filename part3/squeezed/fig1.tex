\caption{Uncertainty region and the corresponding dependence of the 
  electric field on time for a coherent state.
  The complex number $\alpha$,
  corresponding to the considered state $\left|\alpha\right>$ on the
  complex plane defined by $X_1$ and $X_2$ lies along the
  $X_1$ axis.
  In this case, the number $\alpha$ is real, the average value
  $\left<\alpha\right|\hat{X_1}\left|\alpha\right> =
  \frac{\alpha + \alpha^\ast}{2} = 
  \text{Re} \, \alpha = \alpha$.
  Thus, the uncertainty $\Delta X_1$ can
  be interpreted as amplitude uncertainty, and $\Delta X_2$ as
  phase uncertainty. In the case of the coherent
  (not squeezed) state depicted in the figure, the phase and amplitude uncertainty are the same.}
