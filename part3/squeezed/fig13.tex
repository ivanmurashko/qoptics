\caption{Balanced scheme of the homodyne detector. The investigated signal
  ($\hat{a}_0$) and the homodyne mode signal ($\hat{a}_1$) are applied to
  the mirror $M$ with a reflection coefficient $r=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$ and
  a transmission coefficient $t=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}$. The signals after passing
  through the mirror are registered by two photodetectors $D^{(2)}$ and $D^{(3)}$,
  whose output is fed to a subtractor $E$.}
