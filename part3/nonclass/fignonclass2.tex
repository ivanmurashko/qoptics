\caption{Scheme of the Brown-Twiss experiment. Using a 50\% mirror $M$, the light beam is directed to two photodetectors $D^{(1)}$ and $D^{(2)}$. The adjustable delay $\tau$ is accomplished by moving the photodetector $D^{(2)}$. The output from the photodetectors is fed into the coincidence circuit $E$.}
